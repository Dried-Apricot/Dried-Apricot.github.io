# Problem
I've spent 3 hours to fix Jekyll.
It doesn't work if posts or pages including any 'Hangul'
I tried what I can imagine but It's still in vague.

'Commit' is The most suspected.

### Because I checked
1. In local server using Jekyll is work well even with hangul posts.
-> it means my jekyll config is okay.

2. If I write a post directly in the github, It also works well.
-> It means my GItpage is okay.

### So,
I think, problem is the 'encoding' when I commit a file.
But I've not been able to fix it.

I'd figure out this tommorrow
